It's called Kingdom Classic Remake because it's a "copy" of the original game. I made it only for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES. I do not claim any of the game logic nor mechanics. I have changed some things, 
but in general it is a copy.
Some of the assets are from the Kingdom by NOIO, some I have created by myself and some I took a big amout of inspiration from game Kingdom:Classic by NOIO and LICORICE.
